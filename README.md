# Movement-Classification

Tools and Infrastructure You need to have: • python 3.8.0 • TensorFlow 2.0 • Keras The codes are written in and tested in JupyterLabs software. The current project was built and tested in Windows and MAC laptops with 16 GB RAM. GPU's or virtual environments were not experimented or needed at this stage

The Dataset is in Data folder. it consist 16 different persons movement.

The codes are in code folder.

In order to run the code, you need to have LSTM.ipynb and Data in a same folder.
simply run the LSTM.ipnyb

this project is under progress....
